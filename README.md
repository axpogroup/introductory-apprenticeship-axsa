## GitHub Codespace Setup

This repository is configured to work with GitHub Codespaces for a seamless development experience.

### Getting Started with Codespace

1. **Create a Codespace:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click the green "Code" button
   - Select "Codespaces" tab
   - Click "Create codespace on main"

2. **What's Included:**
   - Python 3.11 development environment
   - VS Code with Python extensions pre-installed
   - Jupyter notebook support
   - Git and GitHub CLI tools
   - Auto-installation of Python dependencies

3. **Running the Code:**
   - Open the terminal in VS Code
   - Navigate to the project folders:
     ```bash
     cd monty_hall/
     python task_3_solution.py
     ```
   - For Jupyter notebooks:
     ```bash
     cd python101/
     # Open the .ipynb files directly in VS Code
     ```

### Project Structure

- `monty_hall/` - Contains Monty Hall problem solutions
- `python101/` - Contains Python 101 exercises and solutions
- `.devcontainer/` - GitHub Codespace configuration

The Codespace will automatically install all required dependencies when it starts up.
